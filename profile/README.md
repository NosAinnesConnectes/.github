The aim of the "[Nos Aînés connectés](https://www.nosainesconnectes.fr/)" project is to use digital technology to enhance the well-being of residents in care homes, by stimulating their cognitive and memory functions.

The offer includes :

- An easy-to-use, customizable touchscreen tablet for residents.
- A web platform for the resident's family and friends, designed to foster links between generations.
- An easy-to-use web platform for Ehpad staff.

It helps to maintain an instant social link between these three areas.
The purpose of the association is to preserve the mental health of residents by restoring their living environment and independence.
